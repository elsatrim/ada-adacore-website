## Abstract
It is an established fact that presidential elections have a significant impact on the stock market. Investors react to the uncertainty and potential policy changes that come with a new administration. Understanding these dynamics can help investors anticipate these movements and hedge their portfolios around election cycles. These insights also provide a window into the market's perceptions of different candidates and their proposed policies.

In this project, we explore how presidential elections influence company performance and investor sentiment over time. Using historical stock market data, election results, and prediction market trends, we look at how markets move as the likelihood of one candidate winning changes. We focus especially on how different sectors for example like technology, energy, healthcare, and finance,  respond to the uncertainty and outcomes of election cycles.

Our goal is to show how politics and markets move together in a clear, data-driven way. By analyzing past elections and the upcoming 2024 race, we hope to uncover patterns that explain when, why, and how the market reacts.
